\maketitle

\kant[1]

What we have alone been able to show is that our sense perceptions are
the clue to the discovery of our understanding; in natural theology, necessity,
in all theoretical sciences, occupies part of the sphere of the transcendental
unity of apperception concerning the existence of our faculties in general.

\kant[2]

The Transcendental Deduction stands in need of the Ideal of pure reason,
and the noumena, for these reasons, are by their very nature contradictory. The
objects in space and time have lying before them our ideas. The transcendental
unity of apperception, indeed, proves the validity of our understanding. The
architectonic of human reason, so regarded, would be falsified, as is evident
upon close examination.
